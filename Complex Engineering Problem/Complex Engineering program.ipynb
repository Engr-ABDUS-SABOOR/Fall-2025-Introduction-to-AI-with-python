    "# **Building 2 Energy Analysis Project**\n",
    "## Title:\n",
    "\n",
    "Energy Consumption Analysis and PV Integration for Building 2  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "This project analyzes the energy consumption of Building 2 using the CityLearn 2022 dataset. The aim is to calculate the building’s total electricity usage, PV generation contribution, total electricity cost without PV, grid consumption after PV installation, and wasted or surplus solar energy. Additionally, the project demonstrates how PV integration can reduce grid dependency and electricity costs \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "1) To calculate non-shiftable electricity consumption for Building 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) To convert solar generation data into actual PV energy produced for a 4 kW system.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) To compute the total electricity cost without PV using the pricing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) To determine net consumption, grid consumption, and wasted solar energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) To evaluate cost savings and energy efficiency with PV integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Tools & Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Python \n",
    "\n",
    "2) CSV library import csv – to load and process CSV data (Building_2.csv and pricing.csv)\n",
    "\n",
    "3) VS Code, PyCharm\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Building_2.csv – contains hourly electricity consumption data and solar generation for Building 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Column “Equipment Electric Power [kWh]” → building’s electricity load\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Column “Solar Generation [W/kW]” → PV generation data\n",
    "\n",
    "pricing.csv – contains electricity price at each time step, used to calculate total electricity cost\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why these datasets are used**\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Building_2.csv provides the real energy consumption and PV generation values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) pricing.csv allows calculation of realistic electricity bills and evaluation of cost savings due to PV integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Load Building_2.csv and pricing.csv.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Store Equipment Electric Power [kWh] → non_shiftable_load.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Store Solar Generation [W/kW] → pv_generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Convert PV to kWh for a 4 kW system.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Calculate bill without PV using electricity prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Compute net consumption = consumption – PV generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Separate grid consumption (positive) and wasted energy (negative).\n",
    "\n",
    "8) Calculate totals: consumption, PV generation, grid usage, wasted energy, and bill.\n",
    "\n",
    "9) Print results clearly for analysis\n"
